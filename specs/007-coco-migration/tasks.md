## Tasks

> Status: Implemented in main. This task list is kept as a historical record.

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/007-coco-migration/`\
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓ README.md ✓ research.md ✓ DATA_MODEL.md ✓
CONTRACTS.md ✓ quickstart.md ✓

**Tests**: Contract tests included per Constitution Principle VIII
(NON-NEGOTIABLE: every user story MUST have corresponding tests).

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and
delivery.

### Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete
  tasks)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1–US6)
- Exact file paths are included in all descriptions

---

### Pre-Flight Gate (REQUIRED — blocks all implementation)

> ⛔ **Constitution violation blocker.** The current Claudio Constitution v1.3.0
> explicitly prohibits background daemons in Principle V, Technical Standards,
> and Non-Responsibilities. This migration intentionally violates all three
> locations. The constitution MUST be amended to Coco Constitution v1.0.0 before
> any code is written.

- [ ] T000 Run `lean-spec constitution` to produce Coco Constitution v1.0.0:
      remove "No background daemons or persistent processes" from Principle V
      and Technical Standards; remove "Running as a background daemon" from
      Non-Responsibilities; update Principle I scope from "bridges Claude Code"
      → "universal local AI gateway"; add Configuration Management principle
      (reversible writes, validation test call); update Success Criteria for
      multi-agent support

---

### Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Rename binary, scaffold new module directories, seed shared
utilities, remove replaced files.

- [ ] T001 Update `deno.json`: rename binary output from `claudio` → `coco` in
      compile task; update task names referencing `claudio`
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `src/lib/log.ts`: structured JSON logger
      (`log(level, msg, meta?)`) appending newline-delimited entries to
      `~/.coco/coco.log`; respects `logLevel` from config; no-op when log file
      unwritable
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `src/lib/process.ts`: generalise existing
      `findClaudeBinary()` into
      `findBinary(name: string): Promise<string | null>` with PATH + npm/pip
      fallback paths; add `isProcessAlive(pid: number): Promise<boolean>` using
      `kill -0` (Unix) or PowerShell `Get-Process` (Windows)
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `src/config/store.ts`: `loadConfig(): Promise<CocoConfig>`
      (read `~/.coco/config.json`, create with defaults if absent) and
      `saveConfig(config: CocoConfig): Promise<void>` (schema-validate then
      write); export `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
- [ ] T005 Delete `src/cli/launch.ts` and `src/cli/session.ts`; remove all
      imports of these files from `src/cli/main.ts`; also delete
      `tests/contract/launch_test.ts` and `tests/contract/session_test.ts`
      (these files import the deleted sources directly and would cause compile
      failures; their coverage is superseded by T012's `cli_test.ts`)
- [ ] T006 Bump version string in `src/version.ts` to `0.2.0` (first Coco
      release candidate)

**Checkpoint**: Shared utilities available; old Claudio-specific files removed

---

### Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data types and registries that EVERY user story depends on. No
user story can begin until this phase is complete.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: All user story phases are blocked until this phase is done.

- [ ] T007 [P] Create `src/agents/registry.ts`: define `AgentRecord` interface
      and export `AGENT_REGISTRY: AgentRecord[]` with all 7 agents —
      `claude-code`, `cline`, `kilo`, `opencode`, `goose`, `aider`,
      `gpt-engineer` — each with `name`, `displayName`, `binaryNames[]`,
      `extensionIds[]`
- [ ] T008 [P] Create `src/agents/models.ts`: export
      `DEFAULT_MODEL_MAP: Record<string, string>` mapping common OpenAI and
      Anthropic model aliases to their Copilot model IDs; export
      `resolveModel(requested: string, overrides: Record<string,string>): string`
      applying user overrides over defaults
- [ ] T009 [P] Add OpenAI types to `src/server/types.ts`: `OpenAIRequest`,
      `OpenAIResponse`, `OpenAIStreamChunk`, `OpenAIDelta`,
      `OpenAIErrorResponse`, `OpenAIModel`, `OpenAIModelList` — matching
      CONTRACTS.md schemas exactly
- [ ] T010 Create `tests/unit/config-store_test.ts`: assert `loadConfig()`
      returns `DEFAULT_CONFIG` on first run; assert round-trip write/read
      preserves all fields; assert invalid `logLevel` is rejected
- [ ] T011 [P] Create `tests/unit/model-map_test.ts`: assert known alias
      `"gpt-4o"` resolves to Copilot ID; assert unknown name passes through
      unchanged; assert user override in `modelMap` wins over default

**Checkpoint**: Registry, model map, OpenAI types, and config store ready — user
story implementation can begin

---

### Phase 3: User Story 1 — Background Service (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: `coco start` daemonises the proxy; `coco stop/restart/status` manage
it reliably.

**Independent Test**: Run `coco start`, close the terminal, open a new one, run
`coco status` — service reports running. Run `coco stop` — PID file gone,
service reports not running.

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create `tests/contract/cli_test.ts`: assert `coco start`
      prints `Coco is running on http://localhost:11434`; assert `coco stop`
      prints `Coco stopped.`; assert `coco status` exits 0 when running and 1
      when not running (write FAILING — implement after T017)
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create `tests/integration/daemon_test.ts`: spawn
      `coco start` → assert `~/.coco/coco.pid` written → assert process alive
      via `isProcessAlive()` → spawn `coco stop` → assert PID file removed →
      assert process dead; also test port-conflict scenario: pre-occupy port
      11434 with a dummy listener → assert `coco start` selects a different port
      → assert that port is persisted in `CocoConfig.port` (write FAILING —
      implement after T016)
- [ ] T014 [US1] Create `src/service/daemon.ts`: `startDaemon()` — check stale
      PID, attempt to bind port (default 11434; if occupied, scan upward for the
      next available port and persist selection to `CocoConfig.port` via
      `saveConfig()`), spawn `coco --daemon` with
      `detached: true, stdin/stdout/stderr: "null"`, write PID file, exit
      parent; `stopDaemon()` — read PID, send SIGTERM, poll until dead, remove
      PID file; `restartDaemon()` — stop then start;
      `isDaemonRunning(): Promise<boolean>` — PID file + liveness check
- [ ] T015 [US1] Create `src/service/status.ts`:
      `getServiceState(): Promise<ServiceState>` — reads PID file, checks
      liveness, reads port from `CocoConfig`, calls `/health` to confirm
      running, checks stored token validity for `authStatus`
- [ ] T016 [US1] Update `src/server/server.ts`: when `--daemon` arg is present,
      emit a structured startup log entry via `src/lib/log.ts`, register
      `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` signal handlers for graceful shutdown, bind
      exclusively to `127.0.0.1` on the port stored in `CocoConfig.port` (PID
      file writing is done by `src/service/daemon.ts` before this process
      starts)
- [ ] T017 [US1] Update `src/cli/main.ts`: replace `launch.ts` / `session.ts`
      imports with `service/daemon.ts` and `service/status.ts`; add `start`,
      `stop`, `restart`, `status` sub-command handlers; output strings must
      match `CONTRACTS.md` exactly
- [ ] T018 [US1] Run failing tests from T012 and T013 to confirm they now pass;
      verify `coco start` exits 0 with correct output; verify stale-PID recovery
      (kill daemon, leave PID file, run `coco start` again); manually time
      `coco start` and `coco stop` on local machine — both MUST complete in
      under 1 second (SC-002)

**Checkpoint**: Background service fully functional and independently testable

---

### Phase 4: User Story 3 — OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `GET /v1/models`, `GET /health` all
return correct wire-format responses.

**Independent Test**: Run
`curl -s http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'`
— receive a valid OpenAI completion JSON response.

- [ ] T019 [P] [US3] Create `tests/contract/health_test.ts`: assert
      `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` with HTTP 200 and no auth required
      (write FAILING — implement after T023)
- [ ] T020 [P] [US3] Create `tests/contract/openai-proxy_test.ts`: assert
      non-streaming `/v1/chat/completions` returns `object: "chat.completion"`
      schema; assert streaming returns `text/event-stream` with `data: [DONE]`
      terminator; assert `/v1/models` returns `object: "list"` with at least one
      model (write FAILING — implement after T023)
- [ ] T021 [P] [US3] Create `tests/unit/openai-transform_test.ts`: assert
      `translateOpenAIRequest()` maps `messages`, resolves model alias,
      preserves `stream` flag; assert `translateCopilotToOpenAI()` produces
      correct `id`, `object`, `choices[0].message` fields; assert streaming
      delta wrapping produces valid SSE chunk format
- [ ] T022 [US3] Create `src/server/openai.ts`:
      `translateOpenAIRequest(req: OpenAIRequest, modelMap): CopilotRequest`;
      `translateCopilotToOpenAI(res: CopilotResponse, model: string): OpenAIResponse`;
      `translateCopilotStreamToOpenAIDelta(chunk): string` (returns
      `data: {...}\n\n` SSE line);
      `buildOpenAIError(status, message): OpenAIErrorResponse`
- [ ] T023 [US3] Update `src/server/router.ts`: add `POST /v1/chat/completions`
      route (non-streaming + streaming via `src/server/openai.ts`); add
      `GET /v1/models` route (fetch from Copilot API, return OpenAI model list
      format); add `GET /health` route returning `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] T024 [US3] Update `src/server/copilot.ts`: before forwarding, call
      `resolveModel()` from `src/agents/models.ts` to apply alias map; add 429
      retry with exponential backoff — delays 100ms, 200ms, 400ms (max 3
      attempts); on exhaustion propagate 429 in caller's error envelope format
- [ ] T025 [US3] Run failing tests from T019, T020, T021 to confirm they now
      pass; run quickstart.md curl commands against live daemon and verify
      responses; also verify existing Anthropic proxy tests
      (`tests/contract/proxy_test.ts`, `tests/contract/server_test.ts`) still
      pass after router changes (SC-006 regression guard); measure round-trip
      overhead — MUST be under 150ms excluding Copilot API latency (SC-004)

**Checkpoint**: Both Anthropic and OpenAI proxy endpoints fully functional

---

### Phase 5: User Story 5 — Agent Detection (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: `coco doctor` accurately classifies all 7 agents as `installed`,
`detected`, or `not-installed`.

**Independent Test**: Run `coco doctor` — each of the 7 agents shows a state row
with name, state, and configured status. At least one agent on the current
machine is correctly classified as `installed` or `detected`.

- [ ] T026 [P] [US5] Create `tests/unit/detector_test.ts`: mock PATH to contain
      a known binary → assert `installed`; mock VS Code extension dir with
      extension folder → assert `detected`; mock nothing → assert
      `not-installed`; assert state resolution rule (installed wins over
      detected)
- [ ] T027 [P] [US5] Create `src/agents/detector.ts`:
      `detectAll(): Promise<DetectionResult[]>` iterates `AGENT_REGISTRY` and
      calls `detectOne()`; `detectOne(agent)` runs three strategies in order —
      (1) `findBinary()` from `src/lib/process.ts` for each `binaryName`, (2)
      scan VS Code/Cursor/VSCode-Insiders extension dirs
      (`~/.vscode/extensions/`, `~/.cursor/extensions/`,
      `~/.vscode-insiders/extensions/`) for each `extensionId`, (3) scan
      JetBrains plugin dirs per research.md R-005
      (`~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/` on macOS,
      `~/.local/share/JetBrains/` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\JetBrains\` on Windows),
      (4) check known config file paths; resolves state as
      `installed > detected > not-installed`
- [ ] T028 [US5] Update `src/cli/main.ts`: add `doctor` sub-command handler;
      call `detectAll()`, read `CocoConfig.agents` for configured status, read
      last 5 `error`-level lines from `~/.coco/coco.log`; format output per
      `CONTRACTS.md` doctor section
- [ ] T029 [US5] Run failing tests from T026; run `coco doctor` on current
      machine and verify at least `claude` binary is correctly detected as
      `installed`

**Checkpoint**: Agent detection engine functional; `coco doctor` output matches
contract

---

### Phase 6: User Story 4 — Per-Agent Configuration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: `coco configure <agent>` writes the correct config file;
`coco unconfigure <agent>` perfectly reverses it.

**Independent Test**: Run `coco configure aider` — `~/.aider.conf.yml` gains
`openai-api-base: http://127.0.0.1:11434`. Run `coco unconfigure aider` — file
is restored to its pre-Coco state (or removed if it didn't exist).

- [ ] T030 [P] [US4] Create `tests/integration/agent-config_test.ts`: for at
      least one agent (e.g. `aider`), call `configureAgent()` → assert config
      file written with correct key/value → call `validateConfig()` against
      running daemon → call `unconfigureAgent()` → assert file restored/removed;
      assert `backupPath` logic for pre-existing files
- [ ] T031 [US4] Create `src/agents/config.ts`:
      `configureAgent(agent, port, cocoConfig): Promise<ConfigEntry>` — backs up
      existing config, writes agent-specific format per `CONTRACTS.md`, calls
      `validateConfig()`, persists `ConfigEntry` to `CocoConfig` via
      `saveConfig()`; `unconfigureAgent(agentName, cocoConfig): Promise<void>` —
      restores backup or deletes; `validateConfig(port): Promise<boolean>` —
      POST to `/v1/chat/completions` with 1-token probe
- [ ] T032 [US4] Implement per-agent config writers inside
      `src/agents/config.ts`: `writeClaudeCode()` (JSON merge), `writeCline()`
      (full JSON write), `writeKilo()` (project-relative JSON merge),
      `writeOpenCode()` (env file), `writeGoose()` (TOML merge), `writeAider()`
      (YAML merge), `writeGptEngineer()` (env file)
- [ ] T033 [US4] Update `src/cli/main.ts`: add `configure <agent>` and
      `unconfigure <agent>` sub-command handlers; output strings per
      `CONTRACTS.md`; handle unknown agent names with clear error message
- [ ] T034 [US4] Run failing tests from T030; run `coco configure claude-code`
      and `coco unconfigure claude-code` on a machine with Claude Code
      installed; verify config file delta

**Checkpoint**: Per-agent configuration fully functional and reversible

---

### Phase 7: User Story 2 — TUI (Priority: P1 — depends on US1, US3, US4, US5)

**Goal**: Bare `coco` invocation on a TTY opens the TUI; Space toggles, Enter
applies, `q` exits without changes.

**Independent Test**: Run `coco` in a terminal. See all 7 agents listed with
correct states. Toggle two agents with Space, press Enter — their config files
are written. Press `q` on a second run — no files change.

- [ ] T035 [P] [US2] Create `src/tui/input.ts`:
      `enableRawMode(): Promise<string>` (save terminal settings via `stty -g`);
      `disableRawMode(saved: string): Promise<void>`; `readKey(): Promise<Key>`
      reading up to 3 bytes — returns typed enum
      `{ Space, Enter, Quit, Up, Down, CtrlC, Other }`
- [ ] T036 [P] [US2] Create `src/tui/render.ts`:
      `renderFull(state: TUIState): void` — draws header (status, Copilot auth),
      section divider, all 7 agent rows, instructions footer;
      `renderDirty(state: TUIState, dirtyRows: number[]): void` — redraws only
      changed rows using cursor-up arithmetic;
      `renderRow(row: AgentRow, cursor: number, index: number)` —
      `[x]`/`[ ]`/`[-]` prefix, bold for cursor, dim for `not-installed`, yellow
      for `misconfigured`; hides cursor during render
- [ ] T037 [US2] Update `src/cli/main.ts`: when invoked on TTY with no
      sub-command, build `TUIState` from `getServiceState()` + `detectAll()` +
      `loadConfig()`; enter the Space/Enter/q event loop calling `renderDirty()`
      on each change; on Enter call `configureAgent()` / `unconfigureAgent()`
      for each changed row; restore terminal on exit
- [ ] T038 [US2] Add TTY guard: when `coco` is invoked on a non-TTY
      (`!Deno.stdout.isTerminal()`), print `getServiceState()` output matching
      `CONTRACTS.md` `coco status` format and exit 0
- [ ] T039 [US2] Manual validation: run `coco` in terminal, verify layout
      matches `CONTRACTS.md` TUI example; verify `q` makes no file changes;
      verify Enter correctly writes/reverts config files for toggled agents; use
      `time coco` to measure TUI first-render — MUST appear within 200ms
      (SC-003)

**Checkpoint**: Full TUI functional including service status display and batch
agent configuration

---

### Phase 8: User Story 6 — Coco Models List (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: `coco models` prints available Copilot model IDs in predictable,
minimal output.

**Independent Test**: Run `coco models` (authenticated) — output lists at least
one model ID, one per line or in a minimal table.

- [ ] T040 [US6] Update `src/cli/main.ts`: add `models` sub-command handler; if
      not authenticated, run OAuth device flow first; call Copilot models API;
      print one model ID per line preceded by two spaces; append
      `\nRun 'coco configure <agent>' to route an agent through Coco.` footer
      per `CONTRACTS.md`

**Checkpoint**: All 6 user stories independently functional

---

### Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Distribution artifacts, documentation, final quality gate.

- [ ] T041 [P] Update `npm/` package: rename package from `claudio` → `coco`;
      update `bin` field; update description to reflect universal gateway
      purpose
- [ ] T042 [P] Update `README.md`: reflect new `coco` command name, TUI ASCII
      layout, sub-commands table, quickstart instructions, new architecture
      diagram
- [ ] T043 [P] Update `AGENTS.md`: rename claudio→coco throughout, reflect new
      project structure (`src/service/`, `src/agents/`, `src/tui/`,
      `src/config/`), update development commands to `deno task` equivalents,
      update module responsibilities; delete `CLAUDE.md` (stale stub with
      incorrect commands — `AGENTS.md` is the industry standard picked up by all
      major AI coding agents)
- [ ] T044 Run full quality gate:
      `deno lint && deno fmt --check && deno check src/**/*.ts tests/**/*.ts && deno test --allow-all`;
      fix any failures
- [ ] T045 Run quickstart.md validation end-to-end: start daemon, run all curl
      commands, run `coco doctor`, open TUI, configure one agent, unconfigure
      it, stop daemon; confirm all outputs match contracts

### Parallel Opportunities per Story

```
Phase 1:  T002 ║ T003 ║ T004  (parallel — different new files)
Phase 2:  T007 ║ T008 ║ T009 ║ T011  (parallel — different new files)
Phase 3:  T012 ║ T013  (parallel — test files, no impl deps)
Phase 4:  T019 ║ T020 ║ T021  (parallel — different test files)
Phase 5:  T026 ║ T027  (parallel — test + impl can start together)
Phase 6:  T030 alone (needs T027 + T022 to be done)
Phase 7:  T035 ║ T036  (parallel — input.ts and render.ts are independent)
Polish:   T041 ║ T042 ║ T043  (parallel — different doc files)
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### MVP (User Story 1 Only — Background Service)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001–T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007–T011)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 Background Service (T012–T018)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: `coco start/stop/restart/status` working with PID
   daemon
5. Ship as `coco v0.2.0-alpha` — users can run the Anthropic proxy as a
   persistent service

#### Incremental Delivery

| Milestone    | Stories   | Value delivered                                      |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| v0.2.0-alpha | US1       | Background daemon; persistent proxy                  |
| v0.2.0-beta  | +US3      | OpenAI agents (Aider, GPT-Engineer) can connect      |
| v0.2.0-rc1   | +US5 +US4 | Auto-detection + auto-config for all 7 agents        |
| v0.2.0       | +US2      | TUI control surface; polished multi-agent experience |
| v0.2.1       | +US6      | `coco models` inspection command                     |

#### Parallel Team Strategy

After Phase 2 (Foundational) completes:

- **Developer A** → Phase 3 (US1 Background Service) → Phase 8 (US6 Models)
- **Developer B** → Phase 4 (US3 OpenAI Endpoint)
- **Developer C** → Phase 5 (US5 Agent Detection) → Phase 6 (US4 Config)
- **All together** → Phase 7 (US2 TUI, integrates A + B + C work)
