# Ardo Rename Child: Core Runtime and CLI Surface

## Overview

Implement core codebase renaming from Coco to Ardo for runtime identifiers, CLI
entrypoint, command output, and service/process naming. This child spec owns the
executable surface area and command compatibility behavior.

## Design

This workstream focuses on source-level naming and runtime behavior that users
invoke directly:

- canonical CLI command changes (`ardo`)
- optional `coco` alias compatibility path
- binary/service/process label renames
- user-facing help/version/error text updates
- internal identifiers that safely encode old naming

## Plan

- [x] Inventory runtime and CLI references to `coco`/`Coco` in source and tests.
- [x] Rename primary CLI entrypoint and command help text to `ardo`.
- [x] Update binary/service/process identifiers to Ardo naming.
- [x] Implement optional compatibility alias for `coco` command invocation.
- [x] Add deprecation warning with replacement guidance and sunset timeline.
- [x] Update runtime tests and contract tests for command/output changes.

## Test

- [x] `ardo` command passes existing core CLI workflows.
- [x] `coco` alias (if enabled) routes correctly and emits deprecation warning.
- [x] Version/help/error snapshots or assertions reflect Ardo naming.
- [x] Service lifecycle commands work with updated service labels.

## Notes

Maps from umbrella requirements: R-001, R-002, R-003, R-004, R-005, R-015,
R-022.

Implementation progress (2026-03-21):

- Canonical CLI naming switched to `ardo` for help, version, and user-facing
  command guidance.
- Legacy command invocation warning added when process appears to be launched as
  `coco`.
- Service manager identities updated to Ardo labels (`ardo.service`, `com.ardo`,
  `ardo`) with binary fallback lookup order `ardo` then legacy `coco`.
- Dry-run service install paths now remain testable even without a globally
  installed binary.
- Legacy service-file detection retained for uninstall/isInstalled
  compatibility.
- Deno tasks updated to Ardo-first install/compile targets with explicit legacy
  tasks.
- Verified by contract and unit tests:
  - `tests/contract/cli_interface_test.ts`
  - `tests/contract/cli_test.ts`
  - `tests/contract/cli-install-service_test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/autostart_test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/managers/factory_test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/managers/daemon_test.ts`
