# Documentation Improvement Initiative

## Specification

### User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

#### User Story 1 - Developer Onboarding Experience (Priority: P1)

New developers discovering Claudio can quickly understand its purpose, install it correctly, and get it running with their GitHub Copilot subscription within 10 minutes.

**Why this priority**: The README is the first touchpoint for potential users. A clear, comprehensive README directly impacts adoption rates and reduces support burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a new developer follow the README from discovery to successful first run and verify they understand Claudio's purpose and value proposition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer discovers Claudio repository, **When** they read the README, **Then** they understand it bridges GitHub Copilot with Claude Code interface
2. **Given** a developer wants to install Claudio, **When** they follow installation instructions, **Then** they successfully install and authenticate within 5 minutes
3. **Given** a developer encounters issues, **When** they check troubleshooting section, **Then** they find solutions to common problems without external help

---

#### User Story 2 - Development Team Clarity (Priority: P2)

Development team members can quickly understand project architecture, coding standards, and contribution guidelines to effectively work on the codebase.

**Why this priority**: Clear development documentation reduces onboarding time for contributors and ensures consistency across the codebase.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a new contributor successfully set up development environment and make their first contribution following the guidelines.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to contribute, **When** they read AGENTS.md, **Then** they understand project structure, technologies, and coding standards
2. **Given** a developer needs architecture context, **When** they reference AGENTS.md, **Then** they understand technology choices and recent changes
3. **Given** a developer reviews code, **When** they check guidelines, **Then** they can verify compliance with established standards

---

#### User Story 3 - Project Governance Clarity (Priority: P3)

Project maintainers and contributors understand the project's core principles, scope boundaries, and quality standards through a clear, actionable constitution.

**Why this priority**: A well-structured constitution prevents scope creep, maintains project focus, and provides clear decision-making criteria.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by presenting maintainers with feature requests and verifying they can make consistent decisions using constitutional principles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature request is proposed, **When** maintainers evaluate it against the constitution, **Then** they can make clear accept/reject decisions
2. **Given** code review is needed, **When** reviewers check constitutional compliance, **Then** they can identify violations of core principles
3. **Given** architectural decisions are needed, **When** the team references the constitution, **Then** they have clear guidance on technical standards

---

#### Edge Cases

- What happens when users encounter installation errors on different platforms?
- How does documentation handle users with different experience levels (beginners vs experts)?
- What happens when constitutional principles conflict with each other?
- How does documentation stay current with rapid project changes?

### Requirements *(mandatory)*

#### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: README MUST clearly explain Claudio's purpose as a GitHub Copilot bridge for Claude Code
- **FR-002**: README MUST provide comprehensive installation instructions for all supported platforms (npm, direct download, JSR, mise)
- **FR-003**: README MUST include troubleshooting section with solutions to common platform-specific issues
- **FR-004**: README MUST demonstrate basic usage examples and command-line options
- **FR-005**: AGENTS.md MUST document current project structure, active technologies, and coding standards
- **FR-006**: AGENTS.md MUST maintain accurate technology stack information that reflects current implementation
- **FR-007**: AGENTS.md MUST provide clear guidelines for code style and development workflows
- **FR-008**: Constitution MUST clearly define project scope and boundaries (responsibilities vs non-responsibilities)
- **FR-009**: Constitution MUST establish measurable quality gates and testing requirements
- **FR-010**: Constitution MUST provide clear guidance for architectural decisions and feature evaluation
- **FR-011**: All documentation MUST be consistent in tone, formatting, and terminology
- **FR-013**: Documentation consistency MUST be validated using automated tools including linters, style guides, and terminology validators
- **FR-014**: Consistency score MUST be calculated as: (100 - (total_violations / max_possible_violations * 100)) where violations include markdown lint errors, terminology inconsistencies, and formatting deviations
- **FR-015**: Documentation maintenance MUST use automated triggers on code changes with manual review gates to ensure currency

#### Key Entities

- **Documentation Set**: Collection of README, AGENTS.md, and constitution files with consistent messaging
- **User Journey**: Complete experience from discovery through successful usage
- **Development Guidelines**: Standards and practices for contributing to the project
- **Constitutional Principles**: Core values and boundaries that guide all project decisions

### Clarifications

#### Session 2026-03-08

- Q: How will the "95% documentation consistency score" be measured and validated? → A: Automated consistency checking tools (linters, style guides, terminology validators)
- Q: What is the baseline measurement period for tracking support tickets related to installation and setup? → A: Track 30-day rolling average of support tickets pre and post implementation
- Q: How will documentation handle users with different experience levels (beginners vs experts)? → A: Progressive disclosure with expandable sections for advanced details
- Q: How will documentation stay current with rapid project changes? → A: Automated triggers on code changes with manual review gates
- Q: How will "time to first contribution for new developers" be measured and what constitutes a "first contribution"? → A: Time from first repository interaction to first pull request submission

### Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

#### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can complete installation and first successful run in under 10 minutes based on README alone
- **SC-002**: 95% of common user questions are answered within the documentation without requiring support
- **SC-003**: New contributors can set up development environment and understand coding standards within 15 minutes using AGENTS.md
- **SC-004**: Project maintainers can make feature acceptance decisions within 5 minutes using constitutional guidance
- **SC-005**: Documentation consistency score reaches 95% across all files (terminology, formatting, tone)
- **SC-006**: Support tickets related to installation and setup decrease by 60% after documentation improvements (measured using 30-day rolling averages before and after implementation)
- **SC-007**: Time to first contribution for new developers decreases by 40% after AGENTS.md improvements (measured from first repository interaction to first pull request submission)
