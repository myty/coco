# Feature Specification: Copilot Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `001-copilot-auth`  
**Created**: 2026-02-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Copilot Authentication"

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-02-28

- Q: How should Claudio handle authentication with GitHub Copilot? → A: Use Copilot SDK's built-in authentication (device flow handled internally)
- Q: What level of observability should Claudio have for authentication operations? → A: Minimal - only auth success/failure, no verbose logs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time Authentication (Priority: P1)

When a user runs Claudio for the first time, the system must authenticate with GitHub Copilot using device flow authentication. The user visits the displayed verification URL, enters the device code, and authorizes access. Once complete, Claudio receives and stores the authentication token for future use.

**Why this priority**: Without successful authentication, Claudio cannot function at all. This is the foundational requirement for all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running Claudio in a fresh environment with no prior credentials. The system should prompt for authentication, complete device flow, and confirm successful token acquisition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user with no existing credentials, **When** they run Claudio, **Then** the system initiates device flow authentication and displays verification instructions
2. **Given** device flow in progress, **When** the user completes authorization on the GitHub website, **Then** Claudio receives a valid token and confirms successful authentication
3. **Given** device flow in progress, **When** the user abandons the authorization, **Then** Claudio exits with a clear, calm message explaining the cancellation

### User Story 2 - Returning User Authentication (Priority: P1)

When a user runs Claudio and has valid cached credentials from a previous session, the system should use those credentials without requiring re-authentication. Authentication should be seamless and invisible to the user.

**Why this priority**: The majority of users will be returning users. Requiring re-authentication on every run would create significant friction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running Claudio twice - once to establish credentials, and again to verify automatic authentication works without user interaction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with valid cached credentials, **When** they run Claudio, **Then** the system uses cached credentials and proceeds without prompting for authentication
2. **Given** a user with valid cached credentials, **When** they run Claudio, **Then** the authentication completes within 5 seconds (perceptible but not blocking)

---

### User Story 3 - Authentication Failure Handling (Priority: P2)

When authentication fails due to invalid credentials, expired tokens, or network issues, the system must handle the failure gracefully. The user should receive clear, calm guidance on how to proceed without technical jargon.

**Why this priority**: Users need to understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Poor error handling erodes trust and creates support burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally providing invalid credentials or by simulating token expiration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** cached credentials are invalid or expired, **When** the user runs Claudio, **Then** the system detects the invalidity and initiates re-authentication
2. **Given** a network failure during authentication, **When** the user runs Claudio, **Then** the system displays a clear error message and exits
3. **Given** the user lacks Copilot subscription, **When** they run Claudio, **Then** the system displays a clear message explaining the requirement and exits

---

### User Story 4 - Secure Credential Storage (Priority: P2)

Authentication tokens must be stored securely and not exposed to unauthorized access or logging. The system should use platform-appropriate secure storage mechanisms.

**Why this priority**: Exposing tokens creates security vulnerabilities. Users trust Claudio with their GitHub access - that trust must be preserved.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by checking that tokens are not logged, not visible in process listings, and stored using secure storage APIs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** successful authentication, **When** tokens are stored, **Then** tokens are not logged to any output
2. **Given** successful authentication, **When** tokens are stored, **Then** tokens use platform secure storage (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the device flow times out before user completes authorization?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from GitHub during authentication?
- What happens if the user revokes access after initial successful authentication?
- How does the system handle proxy/network configurations during authentication?

### Edge Case Resolutions

- **Device flow timeout**: Exit with message "Authentication timed out. Please try again."
- **Rate limiting**: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), then exit with message "Too many requests. Please wait and try again."
- **Token revocation**: Detect on next use, trigger re-authentication automatically
- **Proxy/network**: Use system proxy settings; if connection fails, exit with "Network error. Check your connection and proxy settings."

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate with GitHub Copilot using the Copilot SDK's built-in authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a verification URL and device code to the user
- **FR-003**: System MUST poll GitHub for authentication status until complete or timeout
- **FR-004**: System MUST cache authentication tokens for reuse in future sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate token validity before each Copilot request
- **FR-006**: System MUST re-authenticate automatically when token expires
- **FR-007**: System MUST exit immediately if authentication fails with a clear error message
- **FR-008**: System MUST store tokens using platform secure storage (Keychain/Credential Manager) with encrypted file fallback on Linux

### Key Entities

- **AuthToken**: Represents the OAuth token received from GitHub, including access token, refresh token (if applicable), and expiration time
- **DeviceFlowState**: Represents the current state of device flow authentication, including device code, verification URL, and polling status

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete first-time authentication in under 2 minutes from start to completion
- **SC-002**: Returning users with valid credentials experience no authentication delay (authentication completes in under 5 seconds)
- **SC-003**: 95% of authentication attempts succeed when user has valid Copilot subscription
- **SC-004**: Authentication tokens are never logged or exposed in output
- **SC-005**: Authentication operations log only success/failure (no verbose details)
- **SC-006**: Users receive clear error messages for all authentication failure scenarios
